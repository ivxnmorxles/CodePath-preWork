Newapp.io is an app that serves as a introduction for the CodePath iOS development course

Time spent:  hour spent in total
## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
 - favorite apps and their features
 - Youtube - able to view videos while using other apps, personalized home screen and videos to watch
 - Dokkan Battle - HD attack moves, very easy to understand UI
 - Whatsapp - able to change background color,able to import stickers
## Notes
- If i were to make an app better or modify i would choose the youtube app since sometimes it does not allow you view youtube while you use other apps. When using cellular data you can use that feature but when using wifi it deosnt work.
  
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Figuring out how to connect the buttonsto the code and later trying to impliment it gave me a challenge.
